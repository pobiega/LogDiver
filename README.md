# LogDiver
Reads SS13 logs (currently only client side) and outputs them in a more
readable format. Main feature is reading the logfile as it is being written
to by Byond, using a file monitor.


## Planned features
* Let targets contain multiple filters
* Save targets configurations to disk. Load on startup.
* Support loading of server-side log files and parse them accordingly.
